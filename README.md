1. Project is developed using xcode 7.3 and swift 2.2, Could have done it on xcode 8, but unfortunately my system was not updated and considering the time limit I proceeded with my existing system, Which in-fact is not that bad but just 1 below the latest version. 
2. Have fixed most of the ui issues listed, Have used some auto-layout to support different iPhone screen sizes. 
3. No usage of third party libs 
4. Have used Apple Core Data to persist data for different users. 
5. Have used a 3 tier architecture which is basically a model, view and controller. 
6. Have used NSNotification Center to notify events for network requests. 
7. Apps can be run on stubbed mode, this is to show how developers can work if no backend is up and running and proves a best practice for parallel development. 
8. All Utilities have been placed enter Utilities.
